My operating system of choice for my PC is currently Windows 10. It has many advantages for me over other computer operating systems, since it was the first OS I got used to operating within, I find it to be the easiest OS to use and troubleshoot issues and as Windows has progressed over the years, the OS has become easier and more intuitive to navigate. It also has the largest support for gaming out of all the Computer operating systems on the market. I enjoy building my own computers and Windows is very compatible with most parts on the market. Windows has tons of various applications and development tools, making it a great platform for anyone to develop on or connect with others through.
As for my mobile device, I am an android user. I find it has the advantage of being more customizable than IOS, as it allows for a cleaner and more user defined menu screen and smart UI design with this such as the taskbar, which has been around for over 10 years. It also has well as built in buttons for easier navigation. Android has looser standards on its store in a more free market style, allowing for more apps to be released on their devices. Android also allows for technology companies to load the OS on phones they design, which makes for more competition and buyer choice in the device market.
