My operating system of choice for my PC is currently Windows 10. It has many advantages for me over other computer operating systems, since it was the first OS I got used to operating within, I find it to be the easiest OS to use and troubleshoot issues and as Windows has progressed over the years, the OS has become easier and more intuitive to navigate. It also has the largest support for gaming out of all the Computer operating systems on the market. I enjoy building my own computers and Windows is very compatible with most parts on the market. Windows has tons of various applications and development tools, making it a great platform for anyone to develop on or connect with others through.
